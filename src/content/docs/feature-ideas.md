# 10 Features to Enhance the ThinkHome Website

## 1. Virtual Product Inspection Tool
Create an interactive 3D viewer that allows customers to examine refurbished laptops from all angles, zoom in on specific components, and see the actual condition of the product they're purchasing. This would build trust and reduce return rates.

## 2. Automated System Compatibility Checker
Develop a tool where customers can input their requirements (software needs, performance expectations) and receive personalized recommendations for which refurbished systems would meet their needs, similar to PC part picker but for complete systems.

## 3. Repair Status Tracking System
Implement a customer portal where clients can track the status of their repair in real-time, view diagnostic results, approve additional repairs, and receive notifications when their device is ready for pickup.

## 4. Trade-in Value Calculator
Create a tool that allows users to input details about their current device and receive an instant estimate of its trade-in value toward a refurbished system, encouraging upgrades and recycling.

## 5. Component-level Inventory System
Develop a searchable database of individual components (keyboards, screens, batteries) that customers can purchase for DIY repairs, with compatibility information for different laptop models.

## 6. Interactive Troubleshooting Guide
Build a decision-tree based troubleshooting system that walks users through diagnosing common issues with their computers, potentially solving simple problems without requiring service.

## 7. Refurbishment Process Transparency
Create detailed documentation with photos/videos showing exactly how ThinkHome refurbishes laptops, including testing procedures, quality control checks, and cleaning processes to build customer confidence.

## 8. Environmental Impact Calculator
Implement a feature that shows customers the positive environmental impact of purchasing refurbished equipment instead of new (CO2 saved, e-waste prevented, etc.), with shareable certificates.

## 9. Technical Specification Comparison Tool
Develop a side-by-side comparison tool that allows customers to compare multiple refurbished models across all technical specifications, making it easier to choose the right system.

## 10. Scheduled Maintenance Reminders
Create an opt-in system where customers receive personalized maintenance reminders based on their purchase (battery replacement recommendations, cleaning suggestions, driver updates) to extend the life of their purchase.
